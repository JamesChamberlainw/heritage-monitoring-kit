Change Detection for protecting UNESCO World Heritage	

Historical and cultural sites are increasingly threatened by urbanisation and infrastructure development. This project aims to identify early risks to these sites by tracking land-use changes around cultural and historical UNESCO sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/interactive-map/). The project will focus on the areas surrounding these UNESCO sites, dividing them into tiles. Using the PlotToSat tool (https://github.com/Art-n-MathS/PlotToSat), we will extract satellite time-series data from 2015 to 2024 for each tile. We will apply and test various classification algorithms (such as Random Forest, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks) to first classify urban and open areas. Next, we will track land-use changes within these tiles. The system will group the identified changes and generate a map showing the direction of urban expansion. This map will provide insights into when urbanisation might reach each UNESCO site, helping to predict potential risks to their preservation. 

This project is in collaboration with Dr Athos Agapiou from Cyprus University of Technology, Deputy Director of UNESCO Chair on Digital Cultural Heritage.
