# Land-Use Change and Risk Forecasting for Samarra Archaeological City
University of Exeter: MSc Advanced Computer Science Research Project Repository *60 Credits 

# Replication of this Project 

## Setup 

1. Install PlotToSat files in `\PlotToSat` do not overwrite the additional files listed, use of the three files included can be found within the [README](https://github.com/JamesChamberlainw/COMM514/blob/main/PlotToSat/README.md) file in the directory

## How to Replicate After Project Initilisation 

1. Create a Polygon for Site outline (look at `gee.ipynb` as an example, the polygon must be run through `tile.py` then saved on GEE)
2. Run `\PlotToSat\pts_runner.py` and ensure that `pts_runner.py` and your own version of `PlotToSat_test3_shp 1` is adapted for your site. An example of both files can be found in `\PlotToSat` files in this repository.

This is the project up-to-date so far 

next stages will include 
1. Labelling Data 
2. Mapping Data from PlotToSat for training and map visulisation. 

further detials will be added at a later date
